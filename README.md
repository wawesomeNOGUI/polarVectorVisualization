This graphical visualization demonstrates how a vector in polar coordinates (and by extension cylindrical and spherical coordinates) depends on position. 
The basis unit vectors $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{\Phi}}$ in polar coordinates are not constant in direction, 
but depend on the angle from the x-axis $\phi$ at the point which the vector is drawn (a point in polar coordinates is $P(r, \phi)$).

$\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ points outwards from the origin in the direction of a line connecting the origin and a point.

$\hat{\mathbf{\Phi}} is orthogonal to $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ in the counterclockwise direction.

$\hat{\mathbf{r}} = \hat{\mathbf{x}} \cos\phi + \hat{\mathbf{y}} \sin\phi$

$\hat{\mathbf{\Phi}} = -\hat{\mathbf{x}} \sin\phi + \hat{\mathbf{y}} \cos\phi$
